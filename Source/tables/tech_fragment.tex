\caption{Performance of the tested methods in fragment extraction as measured by the Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of predicted and ground-truth fragments, and precision, recall, and F1-score of the predicted fragments.}
\Description{This table compares the performance of two methods, Ours and Rating, in fragment extraction. It reports four metrics: Intersection-over-Union (IoU), Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Our method achieves higher IoU (0.543 vs. 0.414) and Recall (0.902 vs. 0.843), while Rating method shows slightly higher Precision (0.615 vs. 0.607). Overall, our approach obtains the best F1-score of 0.726 compared to 0.711 for the baseline.}
