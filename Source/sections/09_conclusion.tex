\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we propose \sysname{}, an interactive system that instantiates \approach{}: disentangling LLM outputs into fragment-level functions and visualizing the landscape of these functions across outputs.
By extracting and supporting exploration of functions, \sysname{} helps practitioners interpret patterns in how LLM outputs are composed and verifying that the LLM-based evaluator is consistently evaluating these aspects.
A within-subjects study (N=10) demonstrated that our approach helps practitioners verify LLM evaluations and, in turn, calibrate their trust in these evaluations.
Through illustrative case studies, we further demonstrate how \sysname{} effectively surfaces meaningful functions across diverse dimensions and tasks (e.g., reasoning, harmlessness, social simulations).
